# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

## A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in **Bachelor of Science** Majoring in **Statistics** and **Computer Science**.
- I am taking STATS 220 because I want to *develop skills in R programming*.
- I am interested in learning about everything there is to know about data.
